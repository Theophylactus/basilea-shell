# basilea-shell
Weird extremely advanced program I finished in summer 2020. Comes with its own font! The difference between an amateur and a professional is you write your own ~~compiler~~ interpreter and font!
The scriptor function was added a few months after the aforementioned completion, which makes it a completion of the interpreter itself rather than of the whole program I guess

I seriously don't know what this is but I LOVE IT
